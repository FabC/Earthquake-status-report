# Earthquake-status-report
Overpass-query script to report infrastructure damages.

The script can be used on the Overpass-turbo site [2] to show the damaged infrastructure in different colors
(dark red=most damaged, collapsed buildings). To simply execute the scripy follow this link [3].

The script has been derived from the example [1] in the OpenStretMap wiki.
